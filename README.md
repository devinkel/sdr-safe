# Textile Industry Search Application in a City
This is an HTML and JS application developed for the SDRS team at Convertr, with the aim of providing an additional
source of potential client collection. Through the Google Maps API, the application allows the user to search for textile industries
in a specific city and obtain a complete list of stores in the region, including their addresses and contact information.

With this tool, the SDRS team can easily collect information on potential clients in a specific area,
including companies that may not be listed in other data sources such as business directory listings or phone books.
This can be especially useful for companies that work with a specific niche, such as the textile industry.
